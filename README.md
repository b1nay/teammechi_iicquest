<i>Students' Mental Care is a platform that helps students to detect their mental health status and seek help from professionals instantly.</i> <br/> <br/>

Among mental health issue sufferers, the major problem is not diagnosis but early-stage detection. This issue is more common and unsupervised among students, esp. in developing nations like Nepal. 

So to solve this issue, we developed a web-app especially designed for teachers/ instructors / mentors to detect and identify  any existing or probable mental issues among students with simple audio data / text input from the test subjects with little or no information about the diagnosis
 
<h1>Core Features</h1>
<li>	Ensures confidentiality of issues among the students </li>
<li>High accuracy prediction as the used models have been pre-trained on billions of datasets </li>
<li> Diagnoses as earliest as possible </li>
<li>Supports multiple forms of data inputs, i.e. if any student is weak at writing, audio input can be taken, or in case of any student with speech disability, written input works as fine. </li>
<li>Post diagnosis treatment maneuvering </li>
